🧠 Development Notes – The Seekh Saga

Welcome to my learning lab, where I seekh (learn) and sometimes break things.  
Currently starring:

- 📁 `html seekh/` – Tags, headings, and the occasional `<div>` overdose.
- 📁 `css seekh/` – Colors, chaos, and centering divs (or at least trying to).

## 📝 What's This Repo For?

This is my web dev playground where I experiment, learn, and occasionally yell at the screen.  
Every folder is a step toward becoming a frontend wizard (or at least a decent coder).

## ⏳ Still Seekhing...

More folders, files, and frustration coming soon as I progress on my dev journey.  
Expect JavaScript, maybe React… and definitely more questionable design choices.
